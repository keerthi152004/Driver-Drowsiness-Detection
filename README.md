# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
Driver drowsiness detection systems enhance road safety by monitoring signs of driver fatigue through technologies like cameras and sensors that track eye movements, facial expressions, and steering patterns. When drowsiness is detected, the system alerts the driver to take a break, reducing the risk of accidents. 
This Python script implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision techniques. The program primarily leverages the Dlib library for facial landmark detection and the OpenCV library for image processing. It begins by defining a function to calculate the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), which is a measure of the distance between key points on the upper and lower eyelids. A threshold value (`thresh = 0.25`) and a frame count (`frame_check = 20`) are set to determine when the driver is considered drowsy. The script initializes the face detector and the facial landmark predictor using Dlib, which requires a pre-trained model (`shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`).

The main loop of the script captures frames from the webcam and processes them in real time. Each frame is resized and converted to grayscale for better performance. The Dlib face detector identifies faces in the frame, and for each detected face, the facial landmarks are predicted and converted into a NumPy array. The script then extracts the coordinates for the left and right eyes and computes the EAR for both eyes. If the average EAR falls below the predefined threshold for a consecutive number of frames (`frame_check`), the script flags the driver as drowsy. Visual feedback is provided by drawing contours around the eyes and displaying an alert message on the frame.

When drowsiness is detected, the script triggers an audible alert using the Pygame library and the Pydub library to play an alarm sound (`alarm.wav`). This serves as an immediate warning to the driver to stay alert or take a break. The alert system is designed to ensure that the driver is continuously monitored and warned if signs of drowsiness are detected. The script runs in a loop until the user presses the "q" key, which breaks the loop, releases the webcam, and closes all OpenCV windows, ensuring proper cleanup of resources.
